<h1>Year in Review</h1>
<h2>Top 20 Songs of 2017</h2>
<p>It’s been a long long (LONG) and arduous year for all of us. Despite this, there was no stoppage to all the fun, thoughtful, and even downright provocative tracks served to us along the bumpy ride. Below, and over the next few pages, I’ve listed my top 20 tracks of 2017. I avoided adding anything that was released late 2016 (ex. Migo’s “Bad and Boujee” was a 2016 single so though it may have been released as part of 2017’s Culture, it is NOT included here). I’ve also stuck to a “one artist, one song” policy (sorry Kendrick, sorry SZA, sorry BROCKHAMPTON). Got all that? OK. Let’s get this thing started.</p>

<h3>5. LOONA / Kim Lip – “Eclipse”</h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qJEoSa3Ie0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This song might not be the most groundbreaking technically, structurally, or even vocally, but that doesn’t mean that all three of those things weren’t done extremely well. Produced by Daniel Obi Klein and with soft and powerful vocals from an as of yet undebuted Kim Lip, this is a confident track that hits all my sweet spots (that smooth transition from verse to pre-chorus to chorus is one of my favorite musical moments of the year by the way), hypnotic and futuristic, only further raising the hype around whatever the hell this LOONA project is–the most intriguing thing to come out of Korean pop this year. I also previously reviewed this song and MV, which you can read further about here.</p>

<h3>4. BROCKHAMPTON – “BOOGIE”</h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cucHc2vef4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>BROCKHAMPTON is probably my favorite musical moment of 2017. Prolific in their release structure–three lengthy albums in only a year–and with the talent to back it up, the self-proclaimed boy band is definitely a group to watch out for in the future. BROCKHAMPTON was the most difficult group for me to pick a favorite track. Each album carries with it at least three tracks that I would consider deserving of a top 20 place. However, “BOOGIE,” the lead single from SATURATION III, is one that embodies the group’s maturation, cohesiveness, and general musical perspective and thus it is my pick for song number four. Also it’s fun as hell. I previously released a review for an earlier single, “GUMMY,” which you can read more about here.</p>

<h3>3. SZA – “The Weekend”</h3>
<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6gU9OKjOE7ghfEd55oRO57"frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>SZA’s CTRL is basically exactly how I feel about everything right now. But it’s also healing in a way. It’s okay to feel insecure. It’s okay to be confused. But never let someone shame you for what you want or who you want to be. “The Weekend” creates sisterhood around a man with multiple partners, giving SZA–and every other women who participates–their own agency in the entire arrangement. There are no victims here, only women trying to find out what exactly it is they want free of judgement and oppressive societal standards. SZA gives us an opportunity to find solace in her own insecurities and heal together through music.</p>

<h3>2. Kendrick Lamar – “DNA.”</h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLZRYQMLDW4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>“DNA.” is a complex, angry celebration of self but especially the black self in modern USA. Kendrick Lamar, like he does on most of DAMN., sounds depressed and frustrated with his own identity and its relationship to intra- and inter-group representations of black men. But his message here is powerful: simultaneously emotional and controlled, self-assuredly stating his pride in himself and his culture, coming for anyone who would misunderstand him and muddy that identity. It’s masterful and every time I listen I can’t help but be inspired but also cry. It’s the angriest song I’ve ever heard about loving yourself and I love every second. For more on DAMN., I reviewed more in depth here.</p>

<h3>1. Frank Ocean – “Chanel”</h3>
<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6Nle9hKrkL1wQpwNfEkxjh" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>When I first heard “Chanel”, I wasn’t sure if I liked it. But with each consecutive listen, its softness, Frank Ocean’s thoughtful vocal decisions, and the complexity of the lyrics constantly forced me to think and then think again in order to figure out what exactly this song was doing to me emotionally (which was a lot, by the way).It’s a sincere and complex study of identity, artistic and struggling and honest and wow this track just becomes more endearing with every listen. What else would we expect from Frank Ocean? For a more in depth review, please continue here.</p>
