<h2>Kim Petras</h2>
<h3>"Heart to Break"</h3>
<h4>Date: March 29, 2018</h4>

<p>So after releasing bop after bop after BOP, I finally decided it was way past time for me to review Kim Petras, the German pop princess none of us deserve. You may have heard of her before, either on her Charli XCX <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP0r5LSbWL4" target = "_blank">“Unlock It”</a> feature or her biggest track to date, the sugar daddy callout track, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC9FA8lZRy8" target = "_blank">“I Don’t Want It At All”</a> (my personal favorite), but today I’ll be reviewing her latest single, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eC_i6WS1Hs" target = "_blank">“Heart to Break”</a>.</p>

<p>What makes Kim Petras so intriguing is that she uses bubblegum pop themes of the early to mid 2000s (think Paris Hilton, low ride jeans, irresponsible consumerism, being a hot mess) as an aesthetic, parodying–and also successfully pulling off–a certain type of pop princess identity we’ve abandoned post-recession and infusing it with a sweet, all-knowing self-deprecation. This is one of those “we make fun of the things we love” scenarios and Kim Petras approaches a seemingly shallow era of the USA’s recent cultural past with nostalgia, fun, and, above all, charmingly executed pop music.</p>

<p>Petras’ tracks are usually lyrically and melodically simplistic but combine masterful production with a strong and all-encompassing vocal performance by the singer. This is true in “Heart to Break” as well. The song itself is rather straightforward, with a repetitive beat pattern and layered synths that never build to much. But their placement in the soundscape is perfect. The drum machine is just short of too loud and the synthy chords are at once spacious and grounded, filling out “Heart to Break” despite the fact that really there’s only a few tracks in the mix–vocal, a couple synths, and drum machine. And although the synths never really build to much, Petras’ vocals are strong enough to carry us through the lowkey pop instrumentation, transforming verses into technically difficult but highly satisfying climaxes upon each run of the chorus. Overall, the track is simple but effortlessly sweet and it’s difficult to get this sort of pop perfection from something so understated–that pre-bridge breakdown shouldn’t be so good with so little and yet it is. In a boring world of moody pop tracks, Kim Petras’ full acceptance of the poppiest elements of the genre, her sharp vocality, and the full commitment to her aesthetic are a breath of fresh air.</p>
